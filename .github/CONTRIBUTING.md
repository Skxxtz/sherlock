# Contributing to Sherlock

Thanks for considering contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines for submitting issues and contributions.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please make sure to:

1. **Search the Issues** to check if the bug has already been reported.
2. **Follow the Bug Report Template** by using the "Bug Report" issue template. This will help us gather all the information we need to fix the issue efficiently.

## Suggesting Features

We are always open to suggestions for new features. To suggest a feature:

1. **Search the Issues** to see if someone has already suggested the same feature.
2. **Use the Feature Request Template** when creating a new feature request.

Please include:
- A detailed description of the feature
- Possible use cases for the feature
- Any relevant context


## Pull Requests (PRs)

We appreciate your contributions! When submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   - Avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
2. **Make sure your code follows the Sherlock's coding conventions** and adds tests if necessary.
   - If you're fixing a bug, try to include tests that reproduce the issue.
   - If you're adding a feature, try to provide tests that cover your new functionality.
3. **Keep your commits clear and concise**:
   - Write meaningful commit messages that explain why the change is being made.
   - Break large changes into smaller, more manageable commits.
4. **Update documentation**:
   - If your PR introduces new features or changes existing functionality, make sure to update the relevant documentation files (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/`, or inline comments).
5. **Test your changes**:
   - Make sure your changes work properly and don't break existing functionality.
   - If applicable, run the project to verify that everything is functioning as expected.

### Steps for Submitting a PR:
1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** it to your local machine.
2. Create a **new branch** for your changes.
   - Example: `git checkout -b fix/bug-description`
3. **Make your changes** and commit them to your branch.
   - Example: `git commit -m "Fix issue with bug description in README"`
4. **Push** your changes to your forked repository.
   - Example: `git push origin fix/bug-description`
5. **Open a Pull Request** in the original repository from your fork. Usually, PRs should be targeting the latest `unstable` branch and **not** the main branch. If you're creating a new feature where others should can then also contribute to, feel free to mention @Skxxtz to create a development branch for you.


## General Guidelines

- Be respectful of others.
- Provide enough information in your issue or PR description to help us understand the problem or proposed feature.
- If you are fixing a bug, please provide steps to reproduce the issue.
- If your PR is ready for review, tag a maintainer or submit for review.

Thank you for your contributions!
