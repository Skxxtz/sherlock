# Getting Started

## 1. Dependencies

To run the Sherlock Launcher, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)
- `dbus` - (Used to get currently playing song)
- `openssl` - (Used for retrieving Spotify album art)
- `libssl-dev`
- `libsqlite3-dev`

Additionally, if you're building from source, you will need:

- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
<br><br>

## 2. Installation

### <ins>Arch Linux</ins>

If you're using Arch Linux, you can install the pre-built binary package with the following command:

```bash
yay -S sherlock-launcher-bin
```

Or install the community-maintained git build with the following command:

```bash
yay -S sherlock-launcher-git
```

### <ins>From Source</ins>

To build Sherlock Launcher from source, follow these steps.<br>
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)
- `dbus` - (Used to get currently playing song)
- `libsqlite3-dev`
- `librsvg`
- `gdk-pixbuf2`

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skxxtz/sherlock.git
    cd sherlock
    ```

2. **Install necessary Rust dependencies**:

    Build the project using the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. **Install the binary**:

    After the build completes, install the binary to your system:

    ```bash
    sudo cp target/release/sherlock /usr/local/bin/
    ```

4. **(Optional) Remove the build directory:** 
    
    You can optionally remove the source code directory.

    ```bash
    rm -rf /path/to/sherlock
    ```

### <ins>Build Debian Package</ins>

To build a `.deb` package directly from the source, follow these steps:<br>
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)

1. **Install the `cargo-deb` tool**:

    First, you need to install the `cargo-deb` tool, which simplifies packaging Rust projects as Debian packages:

    ```bash
    cargo install cargo-deb
    ```

2. **Build the Debian package**:

    After installing `cargo-deb`, run the following command to build the `.deb` package:

    ```bash
    cargo deb
    ```

    This will create a `.deb` package in the `target/debian` directory.

3. **Install the generated `.deb` package**:

    Once the package is built, you can install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i target/debian/sherlock-launcher_*_amd64.deb
    ```

    > You can use tab-completion to auto complete the exact file name.

### <ins>Nix</ins>

#### Non-Flakes Systems

Sherlock is available in `nixpkgs/unstable` as `sherlock-launcher`. If you're installing it as a standalone package you'll need to do the [config setup](#config-setup) yourself.

#### Flakes & Home-Manager

A module for Sherlock is available in home manager. You can find it's configuration [here](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/master/modules/programs/sherlock.nix). If you want to use the latest updates and module options, follow the steps below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Home-Manager Example Configuration</strong></summary>

Add the following your `inputs` of `flake.nix` if you want to use the latest upstream version of sherlock.

```nix
sherlock = {
    url = "github:Skxxtz/sherlock";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

Home-Manager config:

```nix
programs.sherlock = {
  enable = true;

  # to run sherlock as a daemon
  systemd.enable = true;

  # If wanted, you can use this line for the _latest_ package. / Otherwise, you're relying on nixpkgs to update it frequently enough.
  # For this to work, make sure to add sherlock as a flake input!
  # package = inputs.sherlock.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;

  # config.toml
  settings = {};

  # sherlock_alias.json
  aliases = {
    vesktop = { name = "Discord"; };
  };

  # sherlockignore
  ignore = ''
    Avahi*
  '';

  # fallback.json
  launchers = [
    {
      name = "Calculator";
      type = "calculation";
      args = {
        capabilities = [
          "calc.math"
          "calc.units"
        ];
      };
      priority = 1;
    }
    {
      name = "App Launcher";
      type = "app_launcher";
      args = {};
      priority = 2;
      home = "Home";
    }
  ];

  # main.css
  style = /* css */ ''
    * {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
  '';
};
```

</details>

#### Flakes without Home-Manager

To install the standalone package, add `sherlock.packages.${pkgs.system}.default` to `environment.systemPackages`/`home.packages`. You will need to create the configuration files yourself, see below.

## 3. Post Installation

### **Config Setup**

After the installation is completed, you can set up your configuration files. The location for them is `~/.config/sherlock/`. Depending on your needs, you should add the following files:

1. [**config.toml**](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/examples/config.toml): This file specifies the behavior and defaults of your launcher. Documentation [here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/config.md).
2. [**fallback.json**](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/examples/fallback.json): This file specifies the features your launcher should have. Documentation [here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/launchers.md).
3. [**sherlock_alias.json**](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/examples/sherlock_alias.json): This file specifies aliases for applications. Documentation [here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/aliases.md).
4. [**sherlockignore**](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/examples/sherlockignore): This file specifies which applications to exclude from your search. Documentation [here](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/sherlockignore.md).
5. [**main.css**](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/resources/main.css): This file contains your custom styling for Sherlock.

As of `version 0.1.11`, Sherlock comes with the `init` subcommand to automatically create your config. It will create versions of the files above, populated with the default values. Additionally, it will create the `icons/`, `scripts/`, and `themes/` subdirectories. All you have to do is run the following command:

```bash
sherlock init
```

### Warnings after startup

If you're getting warnings after startup, you can press `return` to access the main application. Alternatively, you can set the `try_suppress_warnings` key in the config file to true. This will prevent any warnings to be shown. The same thing can be done for errors. However, if you suppress errors, the application might not work as expected.

### **Keybind Setup**

To launch Sherlock, you can either type `sherlock` into the command line or bind it to a key. The latter is recommended.
The setup steps vary by display manager. The setup for **Hyprland** is outlined here:

1. (Recommended) Bind the `$menu` variable to Sherlock:

```conf
$menu = sherlock
```

2. Bind a key to execute `$menu`

```conf
bind = $mainMod, space, exec, $menu
```
