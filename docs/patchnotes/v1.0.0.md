## ✨ FEATURES:

### New Input Field for Complex Commands
Let's take establishing an ssh connection to another machine using Sherlock as
an example. Before, each connection would require manually adding a new entry
in your `fallback.json` file. We wanted a more dynamic approach. For this, we
extended the syntax for replaceable components within the command. Previously,
only the `{terminal}` keyword existed to launch the command in the default
terminal. Now, three new parameters are possible: 

- `{custom_text:[Placeholder Text]}`: Spawns a normal input window
- `{password:{Placeholder Text}}`: Spawns an obfuscated input window
- `sudo`: The existence of the sudo keyword inside of a command will prompt you
  for your sudo password. It will then be passed via stdin to the new process,
      making it secure and never visible.



### Minor Features
- Implemented a config key to control the number of shortcuts
- Implemented a `use_keywords` argument for the app launcher, limiting whether
  keywords should be included in the search string.
