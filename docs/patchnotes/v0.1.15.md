## ✨ FEATURES:

### Replacement Variables
Added replacement variables to replace parts of a command at runtime. This
simplifies the process of using commands depending on specific arguments or sudo.

1. `{keyword}` - The searched text
2. `{terminal}` - Your default terminal. Note that the terminal will close as
   soon as the process is completed. To turn off that behavior, do 
   `"{terminal} sh -c \"[YOUR COMMAND(s)] c {other_variable}; exec $SHELL\""`
3. `{custom_text:[optional name]}` - A text field will open asking for a value.
   The name will be displayed as the inputs placeholder
4. The presence of the `sudo` keyword will spawn an input querying your sudo
   password. It will then be passed to the new process via stdin.

### Minor Features
- `remember_query` config key specifying whether the last query should maintain
  in the search bar for the next Sherlock execution
- `use_keywords` attribute for `app_launcher`
- added custom icon theme for `wheather_launcher` using the `"icon_theme": "Sherlock"` attribute
