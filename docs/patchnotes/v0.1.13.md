## Minor Features

### Multi-Selection for Piped Content

You can now use the `--multi` flag to enable multi selection

### Piping for Daemon-Mode

You can now pipe content into Sherlock when running in daemonized mode.

### Improved Cache Invalidation

Sherlock now checks for changed made to the .desktop files.

### Added Theme Selector

```json
{
    "name": "Theme Picker",
    "type": "theme_picker",
    "args": {
        "location": "~/.config/sherlock/themes/"
    },
    "priority": 4,
    "home": true
}
```

> **💡 Note:** It's probably a good idea to wrap this into a category launcher.

### Added Currency Calculator Capability

You can now use the `calc.currencies` capability on the clipboard and calculator launcher to display results for currency transformations.

### Animations are Back

The previously deprecated config key `animate = <bool>` is now back! 

### Photo Flag

Since Sherlock now closes whenever it looses focus, it's difficult to take screenshots of it. This is now possible again by starting it with the `--photo` flag.
